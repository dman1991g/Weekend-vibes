# 🌤️ Weekend Vibes

**Weekend Vibes** is a location-based web app that helps users discover events happening near them this weekend, with real-time weather context to make deciding what to do easier.

The app answers one simple question:
> *“What should I do this weekend?”*

- **Weather-aware suggestions**

This project is also built as a learning-focused app to practice:
- Working with multiple APIs
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Geolocation
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
